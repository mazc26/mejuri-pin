# Mejuri PIN

First of all, thanks for your time and take this challenge, we really appreciate it!
We gonna try to make this challenge and opportunity to see your skills and also interesting for you.

## The concept
You are a front-end rockstar and Mejuri contacted you to create the next product that will change the world: Mejuri PIN.
The main idea is to create a pinterest like board, showing all the Mejuri products, and also allow the user to like them.
The user should also be able to list only the liked products and filter the content by category.

Of Course this site should look awesome in mobile! Because everybody loves browsing with their phones!

Finally, the performance is important, and you are the expert! Please let us know about the strategies used in behalf of optimization and browser performance.

## Letâ€™s do it
We included a candidate mockup.png as a base guide, but any improvement is well received!.
You can check the complete category page [here](https://mejuri.com/shop/t/type).

### All the products in a single endpoint
